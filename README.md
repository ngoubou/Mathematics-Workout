# Mathematics-Workout
A collection of exercises to improve my math skills.
This will mostly contain exercises from "Just the Maths" by A.J. Hobson.

In addition, there will also have MIT OCW and MIT on edX courses, plus Khan Academy.

The main topics are :
Calculus
Linear Algebra
Analysis
Topology
Geometry
Probability

The reason behind this is to help me improve my Statistics and Machine Learning comprehension.

EDIT : I also inserted Penn State courses to refresh my statistics foundations. I found them to be extremely good (particularly STAT501 Regression Methods), so I'll do some of them to deepen or just refresh some concepts.
